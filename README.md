# Tweedieverse Tutorials

This repository houses a suite of [Binder](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) executable tutorials which demonstrate how to use [Tweedieverse](https://github.com/himelmallick/Tweedieverse) for differential analysis of various omics data types. 

The companion tutorials can be collectively launched using the button below. 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/himelmallick/TweedieLabs/main?urlpath=rstudio)

**Note**: Launching Binder can take a few minutes. Once loaded, double-click the corresponding `.Rmd` files in the `R/` directory and click the `Knit` button to get started.

Alternatively, the individual vignettes can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/himelmallick/TweedieLabs/blob/main/R/). They can also be viewed online as follows.

1. [Differential expression of scRNA-Seq UMI counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/himelmallick/TweedieLabs/blob/main/R/Tweedieverse_scRNASeq_UMI.html) <br/>
2. [Differential expression of scRNA-Seq non-UMI counts](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/himelmallick/TweedieLabs/blob/main/R/Tweedieverse_scRNASeq_nonUMI.html) <br/>
3. [Differential analysis of microbiome relative abundances](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/himelmallick/TweedieLabs/blob/main/R/Tweedieverse_microbiome.html) <br/>
4. Differential expression analysis of bulk RNA-Seq counts (Upcoming) <br/>
5. Differential analysis of metabolite abundances (Upcoming)
